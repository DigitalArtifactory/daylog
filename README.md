‚ú® A board based note taking and markdown editor web app.

### Features

- **Editor:** daylog includes a Markdown editor with essential formatting options, perfect for beginners.
- **Search:** Easily find notes or boards with a single keyword using the built-in search feature.

### Production Installation

To install and run daylog in a production environment, follow these steps:
*(I'm currently working in simplifying this steps)*

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DavidArtifacts/daylog.git
  cd daylog
  ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables. 
  **Important:** by default daylog uses SQLite, you can change your conection string to a postgress or any other database engine supported by Prisma ORM. You can follow their [guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/connection-urls) to achieve this step.

4. **Edit the Prisma schema:**
  Open the `prisma/schema.prisma` file and update the `datasource` provider to your desired database engine. For example, to use PostgreSQL, modify the provider and connection URL as follows:
  ```prisma
  datasource db {
    provider = "postgresql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  }
  ```
  Ensure that you removed `prisma/migrations` directory and changed the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file is set to the correct connection string for your database.

5. **Initialize the Prisma database:**
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  ```

6. **Build the application:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

7. **Start the application:**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

8. **Configure a process manager:**
  Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pm2
  pm2 start npm --name "daylog" -- start
  pm2 save
  pm2 startup
  ```

9. **Set up a reverse proxy:**
  Configure a reverse proxy using Nginx or another web server to forward requests to your Node.js application.

10. **Secure your application:**
  Ensure your application is served over HTTPS and configure appropriate security headers.

Your daylog application should now be running in a production environment.
